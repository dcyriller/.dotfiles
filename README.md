# Installation

## Dependencies

Make sure the following dependencies are installed:
zsh, vim, tmux, NodeJs, yarn

## Clone dotfiles

Clone dotfiles from github:
`git clone git@github.com:dcyriller/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles --recurse-submodules`


## Use RCM

Install RCM from https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm

Use it to symlink dotfiles from ~/.dotfiles to ~/.

`lsrc` will do a dry-run

`rcup -v -x README.md` will create the symlinks (verbose mode, excluding README).

It symlinks zsh and shell config. Plus vim.


## Scripts

The scripts directory contains some installation scripts.

`Ã¬nstall_homebrew` will install main packages after a fresh macOS install.

These scripts should be sourced in PATH if RCM step was successfull.


## Setup git

Create a `.gitconfig.local`, set your email and signingkey there.
